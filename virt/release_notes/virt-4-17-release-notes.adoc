[id="virt-about-virt"]
== About Red Hat {VirtProductName}

With Red Hat {VirtProductName}, you can bring traditional virtual machines (VMs) into {product-title} and run them alongside containers. In {VirtProductName}, VMs are native Kubernetes objects that you can manage by using the {product-title} web console or the command line.

{VirtProductName} is represented by the image:virt-icon.png[{VirtProductName},40,40] icon.

You can use {VirtProductName} the xref:../../networking/ovn_kubernetes_network_provider/about-ovn-kubernetes.adoc#about-ovn-kubernetes[OVN-Kubernetes] Container Network Interface (CNI) network provider.

[id="virt-guest-os"]
=== Supported guest operating systems
To view the supported guest operating systems for {VirtProductName}, see link:https://access.redhat.com/articles/973163#ocpvirt[Certified Guest Operating Systems in Red Hat OpenStack Platform, Red Hat Virtualization, OpenShift Virtualization and Red Hat Enterprise Linux with KVM].

//Ensure platform passes Windows Server Virtualization Validation Program. Otherwise, comment out the section below.
[id="virt-svvp-certification"]
=== Microsoft Windows SVVP certification

//CNV-31842 SVVP 4.15 Release Note: NEW
//NOTE: This is a recurring release note. Modify the existing note text below if recommended by QE.
{VirtProductName} is certified in Microsoft's Windows Server Virtualization Validation Program (SVVP) to run Windows Server workloads.

The SVVP certification applies to:

* Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS workers. In the Microsoft SVVP Catalog, they are named __Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4 on RHEL CoreOS 9__.
* Intel and AMD CPUs.

[id="virt-quick-starts"]
== Quick starts

Quick start tours are available for several {VirtProductName} features. To view the tours, click the *Help* icon *?* in the menu bar on the header of the {product-title} web console and then select *Quick Starts*. You can filter the available tours by entering the keyword `virtualization` in the *Filter* field.


[id="virt-4-17-new"]
== New and changed features

This release adds new features and enhancements related to the following components and concepts:

//[id="virt-4-17-installation-update"]
//=== Installation and update

[id="virt-4-17-infrastructure"]
=== Infrastructure

* Configuring xref:../../virt/nodes/virt-node-maintenance.adoc#eviction-strategies[VM eviction strategies] for an xref:../../virt/nodes/virt-node-maintenance.adoc#virt-configuring-cluster-eviction-strategy-cli_virt-node-maintenance[entire cluster] is now generally available.

//CNV-39964 GA: inferFromVolume
* The `inferFromVolume` attribute is now supported for use with imported container disks. When requested, {VirtProductName} can copy the labels `instancetype.kubevirt.io/default-instancetype` and `instancetype.kubevirt.io/default-preference` from a source container disk to the boot volume of a new VM.

//CNV-36328
* You can now select a custom namespace for Red Hat golden images instead of using the default `openshift-virtualization-os-images` namespace. By using a custom namespace, cluster administrators can restrict user access to the default boot sources. To update this setting by using the web console, go to *Virtualization* -> *Overview* -> *Settings* -> *Cluster* -> *General settings* -> *Bootable volumes project*.

[id="virt-4-17-virtualization"]
=== Virtualization

//CNV-34780 GA: Safe memory overcommitment using WASP
* You can now increase VM workload density on nodes by overcommitting memory (RAM) with the `wasp-agent`. The wasp agent assigns swap resources to worker nodes and manages pod evictions when nodes are at risk.
+
[NOTE]
====
Overcommitting memory on a highly utilized system can decrease workload performance.
====
//CNV-36607 Release note: GA post-copy
* Enabling post-copy live migration for VM workloads is now generally available.

//CNV-30590 NEW GA Host-side USB passthrough
* As a cluster administrator, you can xref:../../virt/virtual_machines/advanced_vm_management/virt-configuring-usb-host-passthrough.adoc#virt-configuring-usb-host-passthrough[expose USB devices in a cluster], making them available for virtual machine (VM) owners to assign to VMs. You expose a USB device by first enabling host passthrough and then configuring the VM to access the USB device.

//CNV-40005 Application-aware resource quota
* You can now use the Application-Aware Quota (AAQ) Operator to customize and manage resource quotas for individual components in an {product-title} cluster. The AAQ Operator provides the `ApplicationAwareResourceQuota` and `ApplicationAwareClusterResourceQuota` custom resource definitions (CRDs) that can be used to allocate resources without interfering with cluster-level activities such as upgrades and node maintenance.


//[id="virt-4-17-networking"]
//=== Networking

[id="virt-4-17-storage"]
=== Storage

//CNV-40180 Release note: API is now v1beta1
* The `VirtualMachineSnapshot` API version is now v1beta1.

//CNV-40182 Release note: VM Export API now beta
* The `VirtualMachineExport` API version is now v1beta1.

[id="virt-4-17-web"]
=== Web console
//CNV-49363 Release note: (two notes) New focused view and guided tour in OpenShift Virtualization
* The {product-title} web console includes a new focused view, which presents a condensed navigation menu specific to the {VirtProductName} perspective. This view complements but does not replace the existing {product-title} web console *Virtualization* navigation options.
+
To access the new view, navigate to *Administrator* -> *Virtualization* in the web console.

* An {VirtProductName} guided tour is now available. You can access the tour by either clicking *Start Tour* on the *Welcome to {VirtProductName}* dialog or navigating to *Virtualization* -> *Overview* -> *Settings* -> *User* -> *Getting started resources* -> *Guided tour*.

* xref:../../virt/virtual_machines/virt-edit-vms.adoc#virt-hot-plugging-memory_virt-edit-vms[Hot plugging memory] for VMs from the web console is now generally available.

Deprecated features are included in the current release and supported. However, they will be removed in a future release and are not recommended for new deployments.

//CNV-26426 [DOCS] Release note: Deprecate TTO

* Support for Windows Server 2012 R2 templates is deprecated.

//CNV-34681: Deprecated alerts

[id="virt-4-17-ki-nodes"]
==== Nodes
//CNV-38543 - 4.16 Still an issue
* Uninstalling {VirtProductName} does not remove the `feature.node.kubevirt.io` node labels created by {VirtProductName}. You must remove the labels manually. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/CNV-38543[*CNV-38543*])

//BZ 2151169
* In a heterogeneous cluster with different compute nodes, virtual machines that have HyperV reenlightenment enabled cannot be scheduled on nodes that do not support timestamp-counter scaling (TSC) or have the appropriate TSC frequency. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2151169[*BZ#2151169*])

[discrete]
[id="virt-4-17-ki-storage"]
==== Storage
//CNV-23501: 4.16 - Keep per Dominik Holler
* If you clone more than 100 VMs using the `csi-clone` cloning strategy, then the Ceph CSI might not purge the clones. Manually deleting the clones might also fail. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/CNV-23501[*CNV-23501*])
** As a workaround, you can restart the `ceph-mgr` to purge the VM clones.


[discrete]
[id="virt-4-17-ki-virtualization"]
==== Virtualization

//CNV-36448: 4.16 - Unresolved
* When adding a virtual Trusted Platform Module (vTPM) device to a Windows VM, the BitLocker Drive Encryption system check passes even if the vTPM device is not persistent. This is because a vTPM device that is not persistent stores and recovers encryption keys using ephemeral storage for the lifetime of the `virt-launcher` pod. When the VM migrates or is shut down and restarts, the vTPM data is lost. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/CNV-36448[*CNV-36448*])

//CNV-33835: 4.16 - Unresolved
* {VirtProductName} links a service account token in use by a pod to that specific pod. {VirtProductName} implements a service account volume by creating a disk image that contains a token. If you migrate a VM, then the service account volume becomes invalid. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/CNV-33835[*CNV-33835*])
** As a workaround, use user accounts rather than service accounts because user account tokens are not bound to a specific pod.


[discrete]
[id="virt-4-16-ki-webconsole_{context}"]
==== Web console
//CNV-38594: 4.16 - Still an issue per Guohua
* When you create a persistent volume claim (PVC) by selecting *With Data upload form* from the *Create PersistentVolumeClaim* list in the web console, uploading data to the PVC by using the *Upload Data* field fails. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/CNV-37607[*CNV-37607*])
